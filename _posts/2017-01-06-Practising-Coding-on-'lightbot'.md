    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Mainly by concentrating on the course and planning ahead,
When thinking ahead, mapping out the course in my head really helped so when I went to put in the code it usually took me 2-3 goes.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The first set of courses went well and I feel like I went through them very fast and with ease, But as the harder questions came along I started struggling but still understood. The only thing I would say that limited my learning was helping my partner, but that was good because I can then go and use the skills I just refreshed on.</td>
